# 🎤 Freemium Speech Platform

> Because social media wasn’t stressful enough—now it’s got in-app purchases. 

*(Relax, it’s just a joke.)*

## 🤔 What is this?
The **Freemium Speech Platform** is an experimental chat application modeled in a **true Ferengi spirit**, 
where **users get ONE free (restrictive char count) post per day.**  

Want to say more? **Put your money where your mouth is.** 💰

After all, **if people are going to scream over each other into the digital void anyway, why not profit?**  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Go 🦫 (Gin + GORM)  
- **Database:** SQL, because structured data makes structured conversations (in theory).  
- **Frontend:** Vite ⚡ + WebSockets 📡  
- **Real-time Messaging:** WebSockets, ensuring that your **one free message** arrives instantly.  

## 🚀 Features
✅ **One Free (Restrictive Character) Post per Day** – Choose your words wisely.  
✅ **Real-time WebSockets** – A high-performance system for a low-bandwidth conversation.  
✅ **Premium Speech** – Expand your word budget in **creative** ways.  
✅ **Vite Frontend** – Because even *joke projects* should load quickly.  
✅ **Go Backend** – Optimized for speed, even if the conversations aren’t.  
✅ **Stripe Payments** – Secure and easy payments.  

## 🎭 Is this a joke?
**Yes.**  
But also a **fun engineering challenge** to build a scalable **real-time chat system**.  

## ⚡ Why This (Probably) Won’t Work
- **Hyper-constrained speech** – One free chat post per day, exponential cost of each additional post.  
- **Prioritizes brevity over depth** – The most viral post will most likely be catchphrases.  
- **Encourages extremely efficient communication** – get to the point or get out.  
- **A new kind of influence model** – Who can say the most with the least?  

## 🏗️ Work in Progress
- **Paywalls for punctuation** – Because clarity is now a privilege.  
- **Post with "volume"** - our premium currency that makes your post outrank others for a fleeting period of time. 
- **casino games for speech currency** – flirt with the house edge, cuz you have a lot to say  

## 🚨 Disclaimer
This is **not** a real business model (yet).  
It’s an **absurd social experiment** built with **Go, WebSockets, and Vite** for fun.
